!!! WARNING !!!

Potential users are advised to update and test in a development or staging
environment prior to deployment.

Kiki is not intended to be installed by end users, but any LAMP
administrator should be able to figure it out with these instructions.

Install source files
--------------------

Place the Kiki source tree somewhere on your filesystem. Any location is
fine, as long as your Apache user (usually www-data) has read access.

Create required files and directories
-------------------------------------

* Required: document root

Kiki assumes a domain-based site root under /www, create it with read access
for your Apache user.

mkdir -p /www/example.com
chgrp www-data /www/example.com && chmod g+r 

* Required: configuration file

Directly in your site root, create a file called config.php with read access
for your Apache user and configure your database settings.

cd /www/example.com
touch config.php
chgrp www-data config.php && chmod g+r config.php

See: config/config.php-sample

* Recommended: storage directory

Directly in your site root, create a file storage directory with write
access for your Apache user.

cd /www/example.com
mkdir storage
chgrp www-data storage && chmod g+w 

* Optional: debug file

Directly in your site root, create a file called debug.txt with write access
for your Apache user.

cd /www/example.com
touch debug.txt
chgrp www-data debug.txt && chmod g+w debug.txt

Configure your virtual host
---------------------------

Edit config/htaccess and adjust to match your Kiki install path and site
root. Then place the contents in your VirtualHost directive.

Note: this setup has only been tested within the Apache configuration
itself, not as .htaccess file.

Install required modules and database schema
--------------------------------------------

Kiki offers a status page, available as http://example.com/kiki/ 

This page lists (and checks) required PHP modules and extensions, tests your
database configuration, and installs or updates your data model. Run it
after installation.

Callback URLs
-------------

If you're going to use the Twitter connection, you must configure a callback
URL in your Twitter application to avoid PIN requests.  You can set it to
any value: it is not actually being used as Kiki sets the callback URL
itself in all requests.  You just cannot leave it empty.
