Kiki is a website framework.

    * based on LNMP (Linux, nginx, MariaDB and PHP)

    * completely HTML5 with CSS

It is probably not very suitable for general use.  This is not Wordpress,
it's a collection of helper classes to build upon.

After abandoning this project in 2014 I have only recently (late 2022, early
2023) started using it again for my personal website and as such will be
making updates again.

In due time any and all customisations and actual website delivery will
likely disappear from this repository.

Old notes:

    * extensive use of Ajax and JSON using JQuery
      * Javascript currently required, but the aim is to make all non-admin
        functionality fully functional without

    * single sign-on for Google

    * blog/article system
      * HTML or BBCode-like markup (including Youtube video embeds)

    * picture/album system

    * comment system
    * mail-to-social update channel
