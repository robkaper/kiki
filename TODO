This TODO file lists outstanding work towards a completely brandless and
installable Kiki. It does not include outstanding work in the codebase
itself, which should be documented through FIXME, TODO and Doxygen comments.

- Make all remaining customisations in the code configurable

- Finish installation documentation in .doxygen.php (or better yet, provide
  a simple install.php to be placed in the document root)

- Don't include third-party libraries (facebook.php and lib/twitteroauth)
  but reference them through configuration

- Don't include third-party scripts (scripts/, other than default.js) but
  reference them through configuration

- Provide a status htdocs file and alias checking third-party availability
  and requirements

- Document mail-to-social plugin.
