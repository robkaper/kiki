This TODO file lists outstanding work towards a completely brandless and
installable Kiki. It does not include outstanding work in the codebase
itself, which should be documented through "// FIXME:" and "// TODO" comments.

- Make all remaining customisations in the code configurable

- Finish INSTALL instructions (or better yet, provide a simple install.php to
  be placed in the document root)

- Provide generic htdocs files (cross-domain functionality,
  JSON listener)

- Don't include third-party libraries (facebook.php and lib/twitteroauth)
  but reference them through configuration

- Don't include third-party scripts (scripts/, other than default.js) but
  reference them through configuration

- Provide a status htdocs file and alias checking third-party availability
  and requirements

- Document mail-to-social plugin.

- Make write and offline permissions more flexible.

- Make comment forms work without JS.
