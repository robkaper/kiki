This TODO file lists outstanding work towards a completely brandless and
installable Kiki. It does not include outstanding work in the codebase
itself, which should be documented through FIXME, TODO and Doxygen comments.

- Make all remaining customisations in the code configurable

- Finish installation documentation in .doxygen.php (or better yet, provide
  a simple install.php to be placed in the document root)

- Don't include third-party scripts (scripts/, other than default.js) but
  reference them through configuration

- Provide a status htdocs file and alias checking third-party availability
  and requirements

- Allow creation of new admin user when:
	- masterPassword set and no admin user exists (verify before insertion as well)
	- admin creates a user
	- through site when Config::allowUserCreation is true and email verification is finished

	- Facebook and Twitter connection user accounts cannot be logged into when
		Config::allowUserCreation is disabled (the non-usable user accounts will
		exist however for the sake of their connections from comment
		synchronisation)
