This TODO file lists outstanding work towards a completely brandless and
installable Kiki. It does not include outstanding work in the codebase
itself, which should be documented through FIXME and TODO comments.

- test installation for a simple site without database
- test installation on a 'clean' sandbox VPS to re-check dependencies
- test installation with empty root path (no custom classes, templates, whatsoever)

Old notes:

- Make all remaining customisations in the code configurable

- Provide a status htdocs file and alias checking third-party availability
  and requirements

- Allow creation of new admin user when:
	- masterPassword set and no admin user exists (verify before insertion as well)
	- admin creates a user
	- through site when Config::allowUserCreation is true and email verification is finished

	- Google connection user accounts cannot be logged into when
	  Config::allowUserCreation is disabled (the non-usable user accounts will
	  exist however for the sake of their connections from comment
	  synchronisation)
